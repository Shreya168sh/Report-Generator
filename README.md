# Report-Generator
Generating Report by combining various files is a tedious task. This problem can be solved by automating the process. Therefore, I have decided to build a Report Generator by creating a web application using Flask. The data, which needs to be collated, will be inserted into the database and then the Report will generate in a specified format from database. The generated report can also be downloaded from the option given in the website. 

##### The Tech Stack that I've used for the Report Generator Website is given as follows:
- Python
- MySQL
- Flask
