# Report-Generator
Generating Report by combining various files is a tedious task. Therefore, I have decided to build a Report Generator by creating a web application using Flask. The data which needs to be collated will be inserted into the database and then the Report will be generate in a specified format from database. The generated report can be downloaded from the option given in UI.
